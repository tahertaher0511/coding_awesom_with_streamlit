        CloudbaseLABS is a training program developed by Cloudbase Solutions
        in the fields of Python programming, OpenStack and DevOps technologies
        and practices.

        We’ve been delivering this program in Timișoara for the past 2 years
        as part of the <a href="https://labs.ligaac.ro/" target="_blank">
        LigaAC LABS project</a>, organised by the computer science student
        organization from the “Politehnica" University of Timișoara (LigaAC).

        We partnered with them in 2014 and CloudbaseLABS was born. We partnered
        again in 2015 and received great feedback from the students who applied
        and attended our workshops. Starting from 2016 we’ve decided to expand
        our program to other cities in Romania as well. With an office opened
        in 2015, Iași was definitely the first on the list. Other cities in
        Romania coming soon.

        The goal of these workshops is to help students become familiar with
        Python as a programming language, find out about OpenStack and other
        popular cloud tools, embrace DevOps practices and promote open source
        projects.
        After graduating, students will have the basic skills they need
        in order to start tackling many open source projects and land their
        first contribution.
