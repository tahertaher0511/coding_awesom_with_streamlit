        LigaAC LABS is a project organised by LigaAC (computer science
        student organization from the “Politehnica" University of
        Timișoara) since 2010 and it consists of a series of workshops
        held by some of the biggest names in IT&C from Timișoara.

        Cloudbase Solutions is partnering with LigaAC in delivering a
        full semester of Python, OpenStack and Hyper-V hands-on workshops
        through the Liga AC LABS project.

        The goal of this workshop is to be able to deploy an OpenStack
        cloud for development purposes, understand the general concepts
        and architecture, be able to look under the hood and debug, test
        previously implemented features and be able to fix simple reported
        bugs and start implementing Python code.
