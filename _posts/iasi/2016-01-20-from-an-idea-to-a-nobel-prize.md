We want to use the last days of applications to share with you some of the projects we are working on and how contributing to open-source can have a huge impact on society.

Our biggest and probably most important contribution to open-source has been our involvement in the OpenStack community, where the development and integration of our Hyper-V driver and other specific Microsoft related technologies, ranks us among the top contributors in the past 6 release cycles.

OpenStack is the second largest open-source project in the world, after Linux. It encompasses the work of over 2000 developers from over 100 companies worldwide. It is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, written entirely in Python and governed by the OpenStack Foundation. The project began in 2010 as a joint project of Rackspace and NASA and quickly started attracting more organizations and contributions.

Our vision from the start was to change the way the world sees the OpenStack community by opening it up to the Windows world. We believe in the opportunities given by the different interoperability scenarios that can arise from an OpenStack deployment which can also support Windows based workloads. It switches the focus from limited technological options to a broad range of choices available at the touch of a button. 

To understand the impact of this work, we’d like to showcase one particular user story, that we are proud to have helped with.

Working on the second largest ‪‎open-source‬ project in the world after has its benefits. And working with organisations like CERN is definitely one of them.
How ‪OpenStack‬ helps CERN unlock the mysteries of the universe: "From an idea to a Nobel prize in 50 years with the help of cloud computing”. 

Check out this video of their OpenStack user story, presented by Tim Bell, head of infrastructure at CERN.
