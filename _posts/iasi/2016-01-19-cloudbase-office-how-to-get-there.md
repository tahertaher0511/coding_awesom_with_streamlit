We wanted to give you more info on how to reach our office, in case you don’t know exactly where it is.

First of all, if you’re staying in the Codrescu campus area and don’t know how to reach us, you can do so by following these simple steps:

Go to the nearest bus station.
Take the number [42 bus](http://www.ratp-iasi.ro/trasee.html) (direct line).
In case you are in a hurry, you can also take any bus / tram that leaves for Bvd. Independenței.
From there you can switch to any of the following bus lines: [42, 43 or 43c](http://www.ratp-iasi.ro/trasee.html).

In case you are staying in the Tudor Vladimirescu campus area, you can do the same, by going to the nearest bus station and taking any of the following bus lines: [42, 43 or 43c](http://www.ratp-iasi.ro/trasee.html).

If you are living in the Tătărași area, all you have to do is hop into the number 27 bus (taken from the Unistil bus station) and it will leave you straight next to our office.

Lastly, if you are coming from the Canta, Train Station, Podu Roș or Podul de Piatră areas, then bus number [19](http://www.ratp-iasi.ro/trasee.html) is the one that will get you to our office.

Cloudbase Iași address: Bd. Poitiers, Nr. 6, 700671

Thanks and good luck!
