We're glad so many of you joined us for our board games night event at our office in Ia»ôi.

We had a blast and we hope you enjoyed it as well, got to know one another and found our a little bit more about us, our team and the CloudbaseLABS training that's up ahead.

The pictures have been uploaded on our Flickr account and you can check them out here:

The next board games night will take place next month and we're thinking of making a tradition out of it :smile:

Don't forget that you can apply to our CloudbaseLABS workshops until January 23!

Thank you all for joining,  
The Cloudbase Solutions team!
