If you're reading this it means that you've applied or you're thinking of applying to our Cloudbase LABS workshops in Ia»ôi.

We're looking forward to meeting you, but until we do, we'd like to give you some basic information about the selection process and some advice.

We will have two discussions with you, the first being a personal interview meant to get to know you better, find out what you are passionate about in terms of computer science, what have you done so far and what you would like to learn.
Secondly we will have a technical discussion, meant to find out what are your strong points in terms of programming and IT in general. We will cover the following topics in the discussion: operating systems, data structures, algorithms, general programming questions and logic.

The general advice we are giving you is be honest, talk about your achievements, no matter how small they are and ask us as many questions as possible.
We're also giving you a small snippet from the "Cracking the Coding interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions" book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, leading author in the field.

- **Write Code on Paper**: Most interviewers won't give you a computer and will instead expect you to write code on a whiteboard or on paper To simulate this environment, try answering interview problems by writing code on paper first, and then typing them into a computer as-is Whiteboard / paper coding is a special skill, which can be mastered with constant practice

- **Know Your Resume**: While technical skills are extremely important, that's no reason to neglect your own resume Make sure to prepare yourself to give a quick summary of any project or job you were involved with, and to discuss the hardest and most interesting problems you encountered along the day

- **Don't Memorize Solutions**: While this book offers a representative sample of interview questions, there are still thousands of interview questions out there Memorizing solutions is not a great use of your time Rather, use this book to explore approaches to problems, to learn new concepts, and to practice your skills

- **Talk Out Loud**: Interviewers want to understand how you think and approach problems, so talk out loud while you're solving problems Let the interviewer see how you're tackling the problem, and they just might guide you as well 

We're also reminding you with this occasion that you can still [apply][0] until January 23!

Good luck,   
The Cloudbase Solutions team!
